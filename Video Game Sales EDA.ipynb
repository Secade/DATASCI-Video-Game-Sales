    "# Video Game Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games have become a dominant force around the world by providing never ending days of entertainment. It has proven to be a staple for many younger to middle aged people since it has able to provide moments of fun, memories, and relief. It is nearly impossible to not know about video games during this day and age as it has become more accepted especially during these times of quarantine. It has been used as a way to escape the present world in order to give some kind of peace of mind even for a short while. It has also become a staple for playing with friends or others as communities are being made for liking the same thing. Aside from this, video games have become more profitable as sales of consoles, video games, and merchandise have been on the rise. It has become more dominant in the business world and serves to be a gigantic cash cow if done right. With this, we wanted to explore the different aspects of video games by specifically looking into the different sales trends of video games and analyze what certain genres are popular. Within this notebook, you will be able to find how we processed, analyzed, and interpretted the data to find out the trends in video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we created 10 research questions. These are some of the main questions that came to our minds and wanted to answer them under the context of video game sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",

    "The code block below are the different libraries we utilized to analyze, process, and visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas is used for data manipulation by providing ways to read, store, and export data. It is the main library we are using in order to store the data from the .csv files to Data Frames for processing.\n",
    "- Numpy is used for statistical/mathematical computing by providing easy to use functions to get values.\n",
    "- Seaborn and Matplot are both libraries we used in order to visualize/graph the data we have processed.\n",

    "## Datasets Used\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized two video game sales datasets for this notebook. The first one is called Video Game Sales 2019 by Abdulshaheed Alqunber and the second one is called Video Game Sales 2020 by Bayne Brannen. Both datasets utilized a web scrapping tool created by GregorUT who utilized Beautiful Soup to conduct the scrapping process. They web scrapped the data from a Video Game Statistics site called VGChartz which contains data regarding many games from decades ago to the present. VGChartz served as a good place to collect data since it contains most of the data needed. We double checked and it legal to web scrape from the website. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we are using the 2019 dataset even if there is a more updated version is because the 2019 version contains data regarding the ESRB rating for each game. The 2020 version does not have the ESRB ratings. With that, we decided to merge these two datasets so that we can have more up to date games while having the ESRB ratings for some games. The process of merging will be discussed later.\n",

    "After analyzing the data, we noticed there was a certain pattern for the sales columns in the dataset. We created a new column named \"Total_Sales\" which will show the total sales generated for that specific game version. We noticed that only either \"global_sales\" or \"total_shipped\" can exist at the same time. So if one them exists, then that value will become the \"Total_Sales\" value of the game. However, if both are empty, the \"Total_Sales\" can be calculated by adding the sales from the four regions provided (NA, JP, PAL, Others). Through this method, we are able to see a more complete value of the sales made for each game. This made analzying and processing easier."

    "\n",
    "This section shows the the top 10 consoles with the most number of video game titles. It can be seen that the number of PC games compared to other consoles is way larger. PC games have stayed consistent for decades since there is no need to change much system changes even if switching around operating systems like Windows and Macintosh. Other consoles on the other hand do not support cross-generation games which means that if you want to play the same game on a different console, you will need to buy a new copy. Ex. PS2 Games are not compatible with PS5 Games. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the gaming market, Xbox and Play Station dominate the console market hence their different generation consoles are on the top 10. It can be seen that there are more Play Station consoles that support more games compared to Xbox. This may be because of the different Play Station exclusive games that Sony acquires over Microsoft.\n"

    "## Number of Games per Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show the number of games each game genre has. It can be seen that the top 5 genres are miscellanious, action, adventure, role-playing, and sports. Action and adventure games are dominant in the gaming industry. Games such as Doom, Minecraft, and World of Warcraft are some games that fall under these genre. These are some classic titles that have survived years of playing. Their high popularity has lead other game development companies to produce such games as well which gave rise to more games being developed under the same genre. "

    "\n",
    "In this section we show the top 20 genre and their total sales. The top 3 genres are shooter, sports, and action. These results are not surprising since franchises such as Call of Duty series, FIFA/2K series, or the BioShock series have been popular titles in their own genres. They have been releasing multiple titles under the same name which has lead to a hardcore following where fans keep buying the next series. This further increases the popularity of the genre which leads to even more games being developed in order to lure these fans to other games of the same genre. "

    "## Total Sales of the Top 20 Games for all Consoles\n",
    "\n",
    "This section shows the top 20 game total sales for all consoles. Grand Theft Auto takes the lead followed by Call of Duty, then Minecraft. These games have been published on multiple different consoles such as PC, Play Stations, Xbox, Phones etc. This has lead to more sales on the different platforms which helped reach different people who own different consoles. Having more releases on different consoles allows to have more sales since it gives people options on where to play the game. This is especially true for non-PC users who may not have a strong enough computer to run said games. Consoles are made to run these games hence such sales."

    "## Top 10 Games Per Region\n",
    "\n",
    "This section shows the top 10 games according to their total sales per region. For the NA graph, the games that showed up are understandable since NA is more into the shooter, action, adventure genre of games such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty. These game titles have been popular in NA for quite some time now. For the JP graph, these are games mostly developed and released in Japan hence it has more japanese sales. Grand Theft Auto can be seen within the chart but the other Japanese games are still dominating the region. For PAL on the other hand, it is similar to the interests of the NA region except for the dominance of the sports genre, especially FIFA. FIFA holds a big portion of sales within the PAL region. The sports genre is famous around the European, South American, and South African areas, hence the growth of the sports genre in the region. Lastly, for the other regions, it is similar to the trends for the NA region with shooters and action games taking a big portion of the top 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, titles such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty have been consistent in the 4 provided regions. Which can also explain the amount of sales genres like shooters and action are getting. These games have a big following all throughout the world. "

    "With this, there is not enough data to create a solid analysis on the relationship of critic/user score towards game sales since the ratings vary even with high/low selling games. One observation is that on average, users score games higher compared to critic scores. This is evident in the games above the top 50. The games in the top 50 seem to have higher critic scores than user scores. Though the scores for some games may be high, they do not show a lot of game sales. This needs to be validated by seeing how many critics or users scored that specific game to see how the scale is tipped."

These kinds of games are definitely for any age since they do not contain much violence, gore, or suggestive themes. These kinds of games stay true to their genre and replicate what they are trying to copy. Sports games like FIFA and 2K stay true to the rules of the sport. Racing games are focused on the racing aspect of the game, while puzzles are focused on the thinking aspect of games. For Teen and Mature, they have similar Top 3 genres which are role-playing, action, and shooter. These games now tend to have violence and sensitive themes within the game hence for such rating. The difference between the two are in the top 4 and 5. Teen has more fighting and strategy games. These games have mild violence only. Fighting games are just people punching or hurting one another while strategy games are mostly destruction based objectives. "
